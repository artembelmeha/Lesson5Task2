I am a very old man. How old I do not know. It is possible I am a hundred, maybe more.Ê I cannot tell because I have never aged as other men do.
So far as I can remember, I have always been a man of about thirty.Ê I appear today as I did forty years ago.Ê Yet, I feel that I cannot go on living forever.Ê Someday I will die the real death from which there is no escape.Ê I do not know why I should fear death. I who have died two times and am still alive.
I have never told this story.ÊI know the human mind will not believe what it cannot understand.Ê I cannot explain what happened to me. I can only tell of the ten years my dead body lay undiscovered in an Arizona cave.
My name is John Carter.Ê I am from the state of Virginia.Ê At the close of the Civil War I found myself without a home, without money and without work.
